            <h1>Investing</h1>
            <p>Investing differs from trading in that investing is for the long-term, usually years or decades.
                Investing is one of the
                key strategies to building long-term wealth and financial security.</p>

            <h3>Short-term dips are normal — over time, the stock market has historically trended upward.</h3>

            <p id="breifing">The stock market's history—through the Great Depression (1929, severe crash but recovery
                began in the
                late 1930s), the
                oil crisis (1973, sharp drop followed by late '70s growth), the dot-com crash (2000, tech bubble burst
                but markets
                rebounded within years), the global financial crisis (2008, steep losses with strong recovery by 2013),
                and the COVID-19
                crash (2020, rapid plunge but record recovery within months)—shows that it's not about perfectly timing
                your buys and
                sells, but about giving your investments time to grow. Staying invested through these ups and downs has
                often proven far
                more rewarding than trying to predict the perfect moment.</p>

                    <h3>Technical Analysis</h3>
                    <div class="defination">DEFINITION</div>
                    <p>Technical analysis is a method of evaluating stocks by studying their price movements and trading
                        patterns over time to
                        anticipate future trends. It focuses on identifying patterns and statistical signals such as
                        moving averages, trading
                        volume, and chart formations that may indicate where a stock’s price is headed. This approach
                        differs from fundamental
                        analysis, which examines a company’s financial health, performance metrics, and broader economic
                        conditions to determine
                        a stock’s value.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card2">
                    <h3>Wall Street</h3>
                    <div class="defination">DEFINITION</div>
                    <p>Wall Street is a street in New York City that has long been a historic center of the United
                        States financial industry.
                        Over time, the name has come to represent the entire financial sector. It is often compared to
                        Main Street, a term used
                        to describe the broader economy outside of finance, particularly small businesses and everyday
                        economic activity.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="card3">
                    <h3>Bond Yield</h3>
                    <div class="defination">DEFINITION</div>
                    <p>A bond’s yield is the return an investor earns from holding the bond, expressed as a percentage.
                        It represents how much
                        of the bond’s price each interest payment accounts for. When the price of a bond falls, the
                        yield rises because the same
                        interest payment now makes up a larger portion of its lower price. Conversely, when the bond’s
                        price increases, the
                        yield decreases since the interest payment becomes a smaller portion of its higher value.

                    <h3>Stock Market</h3>
                    <div class="defination">DEFINITION</div>
                    <p>The stock market is a place, whether in a physical location or through online platforms, where
                        people can buy and sell
                        shares of companies. By purchasing shares, investors become partial owners of those businesses
                        and can benefit from
                        their growth and profits. The stock market also helps companies raise funds to expand and
                        innovate. Prices in the market
                        move as supply and demand change, and they are influenced by news, economic trends, and
                        expectations about the future.</p>
